    "1.  Write a simulation for an extended version where there are a total of four doors, rather than 3.  There is one car and 3 goats and the setup is the same: the contestant opens a door, Monty opens a different one revealing a goat and the contestant gets to stick or switch.   What is the probability of winning (opening a door with a car behind it) if the contestant switches or sticks.   Do it by simulation, not math.\n",
